a flask project that generates weird cryptic text that only javascript can read

so you *probably* seen these crazy JS "features", like this one that i found on [wtfjs](https://github.com/denysdovhan/wtfjs?tab=readme-ov-file#its-a-fail)

```js
(![] + [])[+[]] +
  (![] + [])[+!+[]] +
  ([![]] + [][[]])[+!+[] + [+[]]] +
  (![] + [])[!+[] + !+[]];
// -> 'fail'
```
yeah, this project lets you generate these.

- just clone it
- install flask
- run it
- you are done!
